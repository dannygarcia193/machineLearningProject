# Predicting Customer Churn 
### Completed: August, 2020

## Business Goal
1. Learn to predict the probability of churn (for the upcoming month) for each customer
2. Draw up typical user portraits: Select the most outstanding groups and describe their main features
3. Analyze the factors that impact churn most
4. Draw basic conclusions and develop recommendations on how to improve customer service

# Conclusions and Recommendations
Based on the previous findings as well as some external reports, here are some recommendations for improving customer retention and churn:

#### 1. Company should place an emphasis on fostering group interaction activities such as group classes. This is especially the case for the customer profile seen earlier(average age 29) since according to fitness reports , studies are showing the effectiveness of group classes in improving retention rate for fitness studios for those in the younger generation (see 1 and 2).

#### 2. The second month of a user's lifetime should be of special importance to the company. Of those identified at high risk, offer specialized discounts in addition to reaching out to them. (see 3).

#### 3. Create stronger relationships with users who identified as having less chances of churning (coming from partner company or those with > 1 month contract). Offer better discounts or packages for both and continue engagement (see 4 and 5).

### Data Source: Fitness gym data on churn for a given month and information on the month preceding it. Practicum data link not public.
